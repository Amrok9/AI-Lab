# 🤖 Supervised Learning

Welcome to the **Supervised Learning** section of my AI project journey.

This chapter builds on the foundational concepts and dives deeper into **predictive modeling** using labeled data. These projects span a wide range of applications — from finance and healthcare to natural language processing and image recognition.

Each project is built with datasets and focuses on developing practical skills in training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models.

Perfect for:

- 📘 Intermediate learners exploring applied ML  
- 🔍 Practitioners interested in time-series, classification, or regression  
- 🚀 Anyone looking to sharpen their supervised learning skills
