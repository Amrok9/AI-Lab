# 🎓 Foundations

This section marks the starting point of my AI project journey.

It focuses on the **essential algorithms and techniques** that form the core of machine learning. Each project is designed to be simple, practical, and based on real-world data to help build a solid understanding of key AI concepts.

From linear and logistic regression to clustering, decision trees, and dimensionality reduction, these hands-on projects are perfect for:

- 📘 Beginners learning machine learning  
- 🔁 Developers revisiting the basics  
- 🚀 Anyone building a strong ML foundation
